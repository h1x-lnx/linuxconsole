Welcome.

This site is dedicated to using computers only through the console of
Linux systems for all the common tasks that computers are normally used for.
  
You can satisfy many of your computing needs without any graphical
environment (not counting framebuffer here). I am using my personal computers
like that most of the time for many years now and I wanted to share my
experiences in doing so.

If you are wondering why using a personal computer completely without a gui
might be useful, take a look at the FAQ section. Also if you think that this
not so much of a good idea check the FAQ.
  
This site is updated periodically. To see what was updated since the last
time you've visited checkout the git history or the RSS feed.
