# FAQ

* Can you really use a computer just from the Linux console?

	Most of the times. Obviously not everthing works though. My use cases  
let me work from the command line only, but there are others that are  
not suitable for that. Let there be no mistake here - every now and  
then you'd need to start xorg to do something that requires "modern"  
browser. Or to edit an image. Or open PDF with password protection.  
Or do something else you didn't figure a way to do from the command  
line *yet*.

* Does this require a lot of skill?

	Not much in my opinion, but you do need to be stuborn enough to  
figure out how things work and you need to know how to list  
directories, change them and start w3m from shell. All other things  
can be disovered through the search engines. Actually you can  
duckduckgo these 3 things as well, so you just need to be stuborn.

* Why would anyone want to limit themselves to using just a text console?

	There are many reasons why people choose different technologies, so  
I can  speak only for myself. Since I was a kid using computers through  
a text interface felt magical, while all the GUIs felt like shit. I have  
no idea why that is. Feeling of control and simplicity when you see just  
text? Feeling that you can do everything with just a text interface? Being  
somehow connected to the computing history? Illusion the you see what the  
computer is actually doing? I don't know really. I just feel that using  
computer like this is a part me.

	Also - Linux console is not only text anymore - it's capable of  
showing graphics like images, PDFs or playing movies through the  
framebuffer. And yes, you are right there are limitations, but for me the  
fun is also in overcoming them.  

* Can you be as efficient as someone working with graphical interfaces?

	Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It depends. I didn't start using a  
computer like that for efficiency, but because I enjoyed it and when I  
started I never thought that I could be really that efficient. Turns out  
I can, so I think most other people can too. The problem is that often when  
I encounter something new I need to do a little research on how to use  
it from the command line. This time spent on research makes me less  
efficent, at least initially.

* What are the pros?

	The biggest one is that I get to see how programs work. These details  
are often hidden when you work with graphical interfaces. Another one is  
that often I need to automate many things in my workflows and this makes  
me much better in automating in general and thinking about different edge 
cases to create fail-safe processes. (fucking corp speak)

* What are the cons?

	You do need a lot of time to research things and not everything will  
be possible to do. Also some people will make unreasonable assumptions  
about your computer skills and black screen with text draws attention.

* Why not just use a tiling manager?

	I did that too (dwm ftw), but I like the feeling when I don't have to  
use a lot of stacked software just to type letters. I like it when  
the systems I use are as simple as possible and also Linux console just  
feels so good.
