# getting started

This is actually easy - probably in any Linux distribution you just need to  
press \<ctrl\>+\<alt\>+\<F1\> (or \<F2\>) to get into the Linux console. And  
that's it really. You can now ignore gui and use text only interface to your  
computer.

To make the console as comfortable as any other tiling windows manager use  
tmux.

Next step is to [configure][1] your console and after that to setup tools   
to interact with [www][2]. Other useful console programs are described in  
[programs][3] section.

Breaking the habit of going to xorg to check some things in a graphical  
browser was the hardest part for me in converting to using computer in text  
only mode. Damn those habits are hard to get rid of, but now that I don't  
have to use gui my life is happier and full of joy. I wish you the same.
