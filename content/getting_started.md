# getting started

This one is easy - probably in any Linux distribution you just need to press  
ctrl+alt+F1 (or F2) to get into the Linux console. And that's it really. You  
can now ignore gui and use text only interface to your computer.

Breaking the habit of going to xorg to check some things in a graphical  
browser was the hardest part for me in converting to using computer in text  
only mode. Damn those habits are hard to get rid of. Now that I don't have to  
use gui my life is happier and full of joy. I even smile every now and then.  

Next step is to [configure][1] your console and after that to setup tools   
to interact with [www][2].
