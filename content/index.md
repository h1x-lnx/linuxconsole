# linuxconsole.net

Welcome.  

This site is dedicated to using computers only through the console of  
Linux systems for all the common tasks that computers are normally used for.  
  
You can satisfy many of your computing needs without any graphical  
environment. I am using my personal computers like that most of the time for  
many years now and I wanted to share my experiences in doing so. 

If you are wondering why using a personal computer completely without a gui  
might be useful, you might want to take a look at the FAQ section. Also if  
you think that this not so much of a good idea check the FAQ.
  
This site is updated periodically. To see what was updated since the last  
time you've visited checkout the git history or the RSS feed.
