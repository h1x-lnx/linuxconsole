Welcome. This site is dedicated to using computers only through the console of  
Linux systems for all the common tasks that computers are normally used for.  
No X.Org, Wayland, xterm, Gnome, KDE, XFCE, Mate, i3, awesome, dwm etc.  

For the last few years this is almost the only way I've been using my  
computers and I would like to put all I've learned in one place. Here.

you might want to take a look at the below lists.
