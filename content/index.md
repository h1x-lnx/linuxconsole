# linuxconsole.net

Welcome. This site is dedicated to using computers only through the console of  
Linux systems for all the common tasks that computers are normally used for.  
  
**No** X.Org, Wayland, xterm, Gnome, KDE, XFCE, Mate, i3, awesome, dwm etc.  

You can satisfy almost all of your computing needs without any graphical  
environment. Information presented here is to help you do that.  
  
If you are thinking why using a computer like that might be useful or useless,  
you might want to take a look at the FAQ section.
  
This site is updated periodically. To see what's was updated since the last  
time you've visited checkout the git repository or the RSS feed.
